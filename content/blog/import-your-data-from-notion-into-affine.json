No problem! We want you to be able to enjoy AFFiNE, and take control of your data - so we have added import support from Notion. There are a few steps that need to be completed so we'll guide you through that now.\n\n### Exporting from Notion\n\nFirst thing to do is export your data from Notion.\n\n\n![mbp--XFJeikiwMBdA2LiyeV-65FzgHO86K3uksQRC-8=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/mbp--XFJeikiwMBdA2LiyeV-65FzgHO86K3uksQRC-8=.webp)\n\n## Importing Into AFFiNE\n\nThe procedure is:\n\n* Head to All pages\n* Import page (from New Page more options)\n* Select Notion\n* Select your Notion `.zip` export file\n\n![-Qs-Ux7pw4vn6nj5ZVZlqVmfkIqL9Adi9dnQn6xNUxQ=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/-Qs-Ux7pw4vn6nj5ZVZlqVmfkIqL9Adi9dnQn6xNUxQ=.webp)\n\n\n\n### Things to bear in mind\n\nNot all features are supported one-to-one but we are continuing to improve compatibility. So things like Databases may not export perfectly into AFFiNE.
