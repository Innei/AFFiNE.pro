It consists of columns that represent different stages of progress, such as \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" and \"Done.\" Each column contains cards or sticky notes that represent individual tasks or projects. You can easily move these cards across the board to track their status.\n\nIn addition to its traditional use in project management, individuals also find great value in applying Kanban boards to their personal lives. From organizing daily chores to tracking long-term goals, this versatile tool adapts seamlessly to various contexts.\n\n### Why Kanban Board is So Useful?\n\n\n![RVKIBQEPdTUr2d0cuyIx6GymN8MktGAqjeygKfLeiqs=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/RVKIBQEPdTUr2d0cuyIx6GymN8MktGAqjeygKfLeiqs=)\n\n* Straightforward. Tasks are represented as cards that move through different stages on the board. It allows teams to easily see what needs to be done, who is responsible for each task, and how far along it is in the process.\n* Flexibility. Add or remove columns as needed, create labels or tags for better organization, and even assign due dates or priorities to individual tasks.\n* User-friendly. This lies in their accessibility across devices, for most Kanban software apps offer web-based platforms as well as mobile applications, allowing users to access their boards anytime, anywhere.\n* Additional features.
