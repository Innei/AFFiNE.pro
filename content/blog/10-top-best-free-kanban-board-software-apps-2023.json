Tasks are represented as cards that move through different stages on the board.

Add or remove columns as needed, create labels or tags for better organization, and even assign due dates or priorities to individual tasks.\n* **User-friendly**. This lies in their accessibility across devices, for most Kanban software apps offer web-based platforms as well as mobile applications, allowing users to access their boards anytime, anywhere.\n* **Additional features**.
