We will upgrade this web version and retire the old version - along with the old data.\n\n\n\n### What do I need to do?\n\n#### If you have ever used [app.affine.pro](app.affine.pro)\n\n* Head over to [app.affine.pro](app.affine.pro) and backup all your data - local and cloud workspaces\n* All local data will be completely lost after December 14th\n* We will keep a temporary copy after December 14 on [archive.affine.pro](archive.affine.pro) (will go live from December 11 onwards)\n#### If you are using [insider.affine.pro](insider.affine.pro)\n\n* Your AFFiNE Cloud data will be acacessible on the new [app.affine.pro](app.affine.pro) version after it is updated (after December 14th)\n* You will lose access to any local storage data - we advise you to download the [AFFiNE Client](https://affine.pro/download) and activate AFFiNE Cloud\n#### If you are using the [AFFiNE Client](https://affine.pro/download)\n\n* There's no action you need to take\n\n\n### More questions?\n\nIf you still have questions or concerns please do email us: [support@toeverything.info](mailto:support@toeverything.info)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
