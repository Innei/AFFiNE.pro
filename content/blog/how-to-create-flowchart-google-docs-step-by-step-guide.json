Input Texts**\n\nFrom the drawing panel, click on the text icon, which is the letter T. You can now type the content into each shape.\n\nClick on the three dots on the toolbar; other options for formatting the text will come up, such as font, size, color, etc. Select the one you want. Copy-paste text will retain the format.\n\n### **Step 6. Save And Close**\n\nAfter finishing, press on the Save and Close button, it will be added to your Google Document. Double click on the flowchart; it will appear again for further edit or changes.\n\n**And there you have it! Your very own flowchart created in Google Docs!**\n\nBut thatâ€™s not all, here are two of its most challenging limitations:\n\n* **Inconvenient offline work**\n  * Google Docs provides convenient accessibility through a web browser, allowing users to work from anywhere with an internet connection. Moreover, Google offers Drive software for Chrome and a Drive desktop program, enabling offline access to Drive files, including Doc files. However, it's crucial to plan ahead and configure Drive for offline use, selecting the specific files you wish to access offline.\n  * Failure to do so may result in the inability to use Docs offline. It's important to note that while you can access and view previously created flowcharts offline, the creation of new flowcharts without an internet connection poses a limitation. Flowcharts in Google Docs rely on the save button, meaning that **creating flowcharts from scratch offline may present challenges without a Wi-Fi connection**.\n*  **Not designed for flowcharts**\n  * While Google Docs is primarily designed for creating and sharing documents like Microsoft Word, it does have the capability to display basic flowcharts. However, it lacks built-in flowchart templates and a simplified shapes tool, which **limits flowchart possibilities and user experience**.\n  * To create flowcharts in Google Docs, users often resort to copying and pasting shapes to replicate their work. This manual process can be **tedious and time-consuming**, especially for complex charts. Unfortunately, this workaround is not ideal and can hinder the efficiency and convenience of creating intricate flowcharts.\n## **Top 5 alternative flowcharts maker:**\n\nTo address the limitations mentioned above, we have curated a list of the five most popular tools, allowing you to overcome the challenges faced when creating flowcharts in Google Docs. These tools offer advanced features and functionalities that enhance the flowcharting experience and provide a seamless alternative to manual copying and pasting of shapes.\n\n### 1.AFFiNE\n\n\n![J3ly-9oTS9ROUZHn80v2UvXbylfJ309GFY8kNvnTU-8=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/J3ly-9oTS9ROUZHn80v2UvXbylfJ309GFY8kNvnTU-8=)\n\nAFFiNE is a next-gen knowledge base that brings planning, sorting, and creating all together in the [workspace](https://affine.pro/blog/best-5-google-workspace-alternatives-features-price).
