Should you have any questions or require assistance, our Discord channel is open for consultation!\n\n\n\n# **New features released in 0.13.0 version**\n\n## **Page info: Direct Insight into Progress**\n\nSimplistic field types come up short for modern knowledge bases that require 'modeling various types of documents' -- that can be your favorite reading list, movie archive, or academic papers . etc\n\n**On the AFFiNE Roadmap, we're dedicated to incorporating all database fields into document metadata and incrementally enabling document indexing and bulk management via database blocks.** Currently, you're able to add any database field to the document page info, facilitating a clear display of crucial information like deadlines or tasks at the outset of the document, thereby making personal project management easier. Your team will now find the required documents more readily. Additionally, with the 'custom properties' feature, you can select how the information is displayed: show or hide it in the view, or only unveil it when there’s content.\nAfter updating this feature in version 0.13.0, we will integrate the page info more seamlessly with the collection and the 'all pages' view in future updates.\n\n\n<video muted autoplay loop preload=\"auto\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" playsinline>\n            <source src=\"https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/hA08ZnWQOATLzY_JW_KGXwEwwOdYUPzeC7s5_pBYpjM=\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n          </video>\n\n## **Split view: Say Goodbye to Window Switching**\n\nSince the release of AFFiNE 0.10 \"Paris\", the page mode and edgeless mode became merged. You are now able to cross reference just any blocks -- from inserting a frame into page to split chunks of notes and create perfect mindmap in edgeless. However, the alignment of elements appearing in multiple views has always been a problem.**We now present you with AFFiNE's \"Split View\" feature in 0.13**. It acts like a turbocharger for your work efficiency. With just a simple drag and drop, you can activate split screen mode, allowing you to view multiple documents at once and say goodbye to the days of constantly switching windows. Moreover, you have complete control to adjust the size and proportion of each document view to your liking, ensuring every piece of work is displayed perfectly. Whether it's comparing data, checking details, or managing multiple tasks, everything becomes effortlessly manageable. From project management and content creation to data analysis, any task can be made smoother and more efficient with just a few simple steps.\n\n\n![kPdlmZ00Af4t5KZxDDANUcH1i77jEXzDcNf1O5gJ4p0=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/kPdlmZ00Af4t5KZxDDANUcH1i77jEXzDcNf1O5gJ4p0=)\n\n## **Synced block: Achieve Cross-Page Content Sync Instantly**\n\nTired of the repetitive task of updating the same information across multiple documents? Meet the Synced Block feature! It acts like a smart assistant, allowing you to create reusable content blocks in any document and easily reference these blocks in others. The key is that any updates made to the original content block automatically sync to all documents referencing it, ensuring consistency and saving you a ton of time. Whether you're managing projects, studying, or handling personal tasks, this feature simplifies document management and makes your workflow much more efficient. The Synced Block feature is here to streamline your workflow and keep all content up-to-date with minimal effort.\n\n\n![l1Jnzl4bQCssYlsU2VfqfaO2qcPCN0CDqVG-hkEUWOI=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/l1Jnzl4bQCssYlsU2VfqfaO2qcPCN0CDqVG-hkEUWOI=)\n\n# \n\n# **Get Ready to Unlock New Levels of Productivity**\n\nAs we wrap up our AFFiNE 0.12.0 launch week, we want to extend our heartfelt appreciation for your interest and backing.
