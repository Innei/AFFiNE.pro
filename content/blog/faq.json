However, we are actively discussing further improvements to enhance data structuring within our product development team, and we plan to introduce iterative updates in the near future.\n\n\n![I4f9L5oAo7Hcu8HckQ-mY1RNTR8-q0BZBsrhAOK1jbQ=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/I4f9L5oAo7Hcu8HckQ-mY1RNTR8-q0BZBsrhAOK1jbQ=)\n\n\n\n### **Q: Is there an option for toggle/outline lists?**\n\nA: Unfortunately, the requested feature is not available at present. We appreciate its importance, but it is not yet available in the stable version. We request your patience as we work towards including it in future updates.

Additionally, our free version of cloud services will also be introduced. If you wish to experience AFFiNE Cloud's services in advance, we cordially invite you to participate in our exclusive \"Early Access Believer Program.\" You can find more information here: [https://affine.pro/blog/affine-cloud-early-access](https://affine.pro/blog/affine-cloud-early-access).

You can log in to AFFiNE with this email. Additionally, you have the option to sign in using your Google account.\n1. **Create Your Cloud Workspace**: You can create a local workspace and then enable it to a cloud workspace.\n  \n![VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=)\n\n  \n\n1. **Invite your collaborators**: You can add user emails to the workspace and invite collaborators to work together.\n  \n![RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=)\n\n**Detailed Guidelines**: For more detailed instructions or information about the new features or changes in the service, you can refer to the provided link: [https://affine.pro/blog/what-is-new-affine-0922](https://affine.pro/blog/what-is-new-affine-0922)\n\n\n\n### **Q: Isn't the Docker image meant for self-hosting? Why is that dependent on the cloud?**\n\nA: The Docker image is primarily designed for self-hosting, enabling users to run it on their own servers. Nevertheless, it is built to provide flexibility. Users have the option to configure it to integrate with cloud services if they find it necessary, depending on their specific needs. Regardless of whether you choose to utilize cloud services or host locally, deploying the architecture remains an essential step.\n\n\n\n### **Q: Is the underlying collaboration technology shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions?**\n\nA: Yes, the underlying collaboration technology is shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions. This ensures consistency in features and functionality across different deployment options. Please note that while local peer-to-peer (P2P) collaboration features may not have been developed yet, the core collaboration technology remains consistent across all deployment methods. We anticipate these improvements to be rolled out by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n### **Q: Does AFFiNE provide support for end-to-end encryption?**\n\nA: Certainly, AFFiNE extends robust support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Our platform prioritizes data security while fostering seamless teamwork within local networks. With AFFiNE, you can confidently leverage E2EE alongside local area network (LAN) collaboration. Moreover, our collaboration framework, based on Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensures that real-time collaboration remains unhindered by geographical constraints, network speeds, and even offline usage. We anticipate these improvements to be rolled out by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n### **Q: Where is my page stored?**\n\nA:\n\n### **`app.getPath(name)`**\n\n* `name` string - You can request the following paths by the name:\n  * `home` User's home directory.\n  * `appData` Per-user application data directory, which by default points to:\n    * `%APPDATA%` on Windows\n    * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config` on Linux\n    * `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS\n  * `userData` The directory for storing your app's configuration files, whichby default is the `appData` directory appended with your app's name. Byconvention files storing user data should be written to this directory, andit is not recommended to write large files here because some environmentsmay backup this directory to cloud storage.\n  * `sessionData` The directory for storing data generated by `Session`, suchas localStorage, cookies, disk cache, downloaded dictionaries, networkstate, devtools files. By default this points to `userData`. Chromium maywrite very large disk cache here, so if your app does not rely on browserstorage like localStorage or cookies to save user data, it is recommendedto set this directory to other locations to avoid polluting the `userData`directory.\nYou might want to backup the whole `userData` folder. But still it does not ensure the backup will work in the future version. It is recommended to install the same version when you backup, upgrade to the latest version, and backup again.\n\n\n\n# 6) **Others**\n\n### **Q: Is it possible to build 3rd-party plugins now?**\n\nA: The plugin system is in early development, accessible exclusively within the Canary version. We are actively progressing with this feature and anticipate its availability by year-end. First-party plugins will be developed initially, followed by integration of GitHub and Figma plugins, scheduled for launch in January 2024. We also plan to introduce a stable API interface in the coming year, enabling users to create third-party plugins.\n\n\n\nIf the information provided above does not address your question, **please feel free to reach out to us on our community forum, Discord, or Telegram**.
