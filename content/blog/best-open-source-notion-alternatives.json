It is widely popular due to its versatility, clean interface, and the ability to customise the layout and design of pages and databases. However, Notion is not the only option available, and there are some fantastic open-source alternatives to consider. In this article, we will explore the top 5 open-source Notion alternatives and highlight their main advantages over Notion.\n\n## Notion: An Overview\n\nNotion is a comprehensive tool that is more than just a project management application. It is an advanced document editor, a storage location, and a collaboration tool with numerous integrations. Notion provides a clean and visually appealing interface that is simple to navigate. Notion also allows for a high level of customisation, making it easy to tailor the layout and design of pages and databases to specific requirements. Furthermore, Notion is very flexible and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as note-taking, task management, project management, and more. However, Notion can be expensive for individuals or small teams, and it has a steep learning curve. So that's why you might want to find an alternative to Notion - so let's today explore some open-source alternatives.\n\n### AFFiNE: All-in-One Notion Alternative\n\n\n![9LBVYo0Ad6RnjJPHeFW7czYmjn-8ja2_TV-HySCbyc0=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/9LBVYo0Ad6RnjJPHeFW7czYmjn-8ja2_TV-HySCbyc0=)\n\n\n\n[AFFiNE](https://affine.pro) is a next-generation knowledge base that combines the best of Notion and Miro into one app. It is a powerful and flexible open-source tool that offers a wide range of features for note-taking, task management, and project collaboration.
